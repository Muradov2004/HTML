		<h3>
			Linear Equations
		</h3>
		<p>
			A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			<mark>ax + b = 0</mark>
		</p>
		<p>
			where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are real numbers and <em>x</em> is a variable. This form is sometimes
			called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this
			form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <em>x</em> so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an
			<em>x</em> there.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Quadratic Equation
		</h3>
		<p>
			The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			<mark>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</mark>
		</p>
		<p>
			where <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> are known values and <em>x</em> is the variable or unknown (we
			don't know it yet). Also, <em>a</em> can't be 0.
		</p>

		<h3>
			The area of a circle (A)
		</h3>

		<p>
			<em>&pi;</em> (Pi) times the radius (<em>r</em>) squared:
		</p>

		<p class="equation">
			<mark>A = &pi; &Cross; r^2</mark>
		</p>
		<p>
			or, when you know the diameter (<em>D</em>):
		</p>

		<p class="equation">
			<mark>A = (&pi; / 4) &Cross; D<sup>2</sup></mark>
		</p>

		<p>
			or, when you know the circumference (<em>C</em>):
		</p>

		<p class="equation">
			<mark>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &Cross; &pi;</mark>
		</p>

		<h3>
			Intersection
		</h3>

		<p>
			The intersection of two sets <em>A</em> and <em>b</em>, denoted by A &bigcap; B, is the set of all
			objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,
		</p>

		<p class="equation">
			<mark>A &bigcap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }</mark>
		</p>

		<p>
			That is, <em>x</em> is an element of the intersection A &bigcap; B if and only if <em>x</em> is both an
			element of <em>A</em> and an element of <em>B</em>.
