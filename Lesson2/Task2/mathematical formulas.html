		<h3>
			Linear Equations
		</h3>
		<p>
			A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			<mark>ax + b = 0</mark>
		</p>
		<p>
			where a and b are real numbers and x is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a
			linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or
			may not be an x so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an x there.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Quadratic Equation
		</h3>
		<p>
			The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
		</p>
		<p class="equation">
			<mark>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</mark>
		</p>
		<p>
			where a, b, c are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, a can't be 0.
		</p>

		<h3>
			The area of a circle (A)
		</h3>

		<p>
			&pi; (Pi) times the radius (r) squared:
		</p>

		<p class="equation">
			<mark>A = &pi; &Cross; r^2</mark>
		</p>
		<p>
			or, when you know the diameter (D):
		</p>

		<p class="equation">
			<mark>A = (&pi; / 4) &Cross; D<sup>2</sup></mark>
		</p>

		<p>
			or, when you know the circumference (C):
		</p>

		<p class="equation">
			<mark>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &Cross; &pi;</mark>
		</p>

		<h3>
			Intersection
		</h3>

		<p>
			The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A &bigcap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of
			both the sets A and B. In symbols,
		</p>

		<p class="equation">
			<mark>A &bigcap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }</mark>
		</p>

		<p>
			That is, x is an element of the intersection A &bigcap; B if and only if x is both an element of A and an
			element of B.
