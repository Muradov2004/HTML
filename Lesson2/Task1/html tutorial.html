			What is HTML?
		</h3>


		<p>
			<strong>Hypertext Markup Language (<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>)</strong> is the
			standard
			markup language for creating web pages and web
			applications.
		</p>

		<p>
			Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
			multimedia
			web
			pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the
			appearance
			of
			the
			document.
		</p>

		<p>

			HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
			interactive
			forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
			denoting
			structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML
			elements
			are
			delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <span>&lt;img/&gt;</span> and
			<span>&lt;input/&gt;</span>
			directly introduce
			content into the
			page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include
			other
			tags
			as
			sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

		<h3>
			Markup
		</h3>

		HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),
		character-based
		data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like
		&lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example &lt;img&gt;.
		The
		first tag in such a
		pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).

		Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.

		The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
		<br>
		<pre>
			<code>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
			</code>
		</pre>
